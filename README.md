# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Performing analysis on PH database department to get this organized for the company. 

## Overview of Project
Using *PostgreSQL* to create a database and *pgAdmin* to work with the data imported. The manager given us two nore assignments. The purpose of this analysis was to 1) Determine the number of retiring employees per title, and 2) Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Afterwards, we write a report that summarizes the analysis and help prepare the manager for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. 

Within the first table (retirement_titles.csv) included: *employee number*, *first and last name*, *position title*, and *from and to date*. In the second table (mentorship_eligibility.csv), included: *employee number*, *first and last name*, *birth date*, *from and to date*, and *position title*. 


## Results

This data table shows the number of retiring employees per title: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/dewong1/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv)

This data table shows employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/dewong1/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

### Four major points from the two analysis deliverables 

* According to the retiring_titles.csv data, it appears that the two position titles with the most retirement includes: *Senior Engineer* (29,414) and *Senior Staff* (28,254), followed up with third most retired position: Engineer (14,222).

* Based on the point above, *Senior Engineer* and *Senior Staff* positions are in current high priority when it comes to the company's need of filling potnetntial opened roles.

* According to the mentorship_eligibility.csv data, there are currently 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program.

* Based on the data, there are more people retiring (<70,000) than employees qualifying for the mentorship program (1,549), which means that the company will have to create an efficient program that can cover the disparity between the number of people reitring and the number of people who can be mentored to fill these positions.
